# Redact Personal Identifiable information as a service

This is a simple microservice that will accept a JSON string as input to the `/redact` endpoint and return a JSON string with the PII redacted based on regular expressions stored as JSON.

This project is part of a course on Rust For DevOps which will teach you how to use Rust while you learn DevOps principles like logging, testing, monitoring, automation, CI/CD, containers, and deployment.
